database/sql: Provides SQL database access.

Interface DBTX

defines methods that any database *transaction* or *connection* must implement:

-ExecContext: Executes a query without returning any rows.
-PrepareContext: Prepares a statement for later queries or executions.
-QueryContext: Executes a query that returns rows.
-QueryRowContext: Executes a query that is expected to return at most one row.


Struct Queries

type Queries struct {
    db DBTX
}

holds a reference to a DBTX interface, 

Constructor New

func New(db DBTX) *Queries {
    return &Queries{db: db}
}

function creates a new Queries instance with the provided DBTX interface.


Method WithTx

allows creating a new Queries instance that uses a transaction (*sql.Tx) instead of a regular database connection

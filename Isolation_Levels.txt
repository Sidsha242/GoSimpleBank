We need to use a correct isolation level

ACID - Atomicity ; Consistency ; Isolation ; Durability ; 

Isolation : Concurrent transactions must not affect each other

Read Phenomena : interfearence among transactions

 - Dirty Read : Transaction reads data written by other concurrent uncommitted transactions

 - Non-Repeatable Read : Transaction reads the same row twice and sees different value because it has been modified by other committed transactions

 - Phantom Read : A transaction re-executed a query to find rows different due to changes by other committed transaction.(affects multiple rows)

 - Serialization Anomly : group of concurrent committed transactions impossible to achieve. 


4 Standard Isolation level
- Read uncommitted : Can see data written by uncommitted transaction (allows dirty read)
- Read committed : Can only see data written by committed transaction
- Repeatable Read : Same read query always returns same result
- Serializable : Execute Concurrent transactions serially
